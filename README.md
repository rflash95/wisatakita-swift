# wisatakita-swift


This is my first iOS app using the SwiftUI. This app displays tourist attractions from the https://tourism-api.dicoding.dev/list API and also has a "View route on map" button on the detail page.

The Figma UI design for this app can be found at the following link: https://www.figma.com/file/UCKba4Koc3DKAYiwiG0qBy/WisataKita?node-id=0%3A1

The Figma prototype for this app can be viewed at: https://www.figma.com/proto/UCKba4Koc3DKAYiwiG0qBy/WisataKita?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=7%3A368&viewport=150%2C306%2C0.51&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=7%3A368

The checklist from the reviewer:

✅ This app uses a list format to display images and information for at least 10 items. When one of the items is selected, detailed information about the item appears.

✅ The app uses layout anchors, storyboards/XIBs, or SwiftUI to arrange the detail page, and implements Auto Layout to ensure that the page is displayed correctly on different devices and screen sizes.

✅ The app also displays the creator's personal information, including their name and a photo of themselves.

✅ The app functions properly without any bugs, crashes, or other issues, and all of its features work as intended.
